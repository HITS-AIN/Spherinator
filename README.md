# Spherinator & HiPSter

`Spherinator` uses [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) based variational autoencoder (VAE) with a spherical latent space.
`HiPSter` creates the HiPS tilings and the catalog which can be visualized interactively on the surface of a sphere with [Aladin Lite](https://github.com/cds-astro/aladin-lite).

## Installation

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for installation.

```bash
poetry install
```


## LightningCLI

[LightningCLI](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/cli/lightning_cli.html#lightning-cli) is a command line interface separating source code from hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are defined in a YAML file `config.yaml` and passed to the CLI.

```bash
python spherinator.py fit -c experiments/illustris_power.yaml
```

Arguments can be directly defined on the command line and overwrite the YAML file.
Examples:

- Define number of latent dimensions: `--model.init_args.z_dim 16`
- Define GPU indices: `--trainer.devices [0,1]`
- Define number of epochs: `--trainer.max_epochs 100`


## Generate HiPS and catalog

The following command generates a HiPS representation and a catalog showing the real images located on the latent space using the trained model.

```bash
./hipster.py --checkpoint <checkpoint-file>.ckpt
```

Call `./hipster.py --help` for more information.

For visualization, a Python HTTP server can be started by executing `python3 -m http.server 8082` within the HiPSter output file.


## Profiling

The Pytorch profiler can be used by appending the `profiler_pytorch.yaml` config file to the command line.

```bash
python spherinator.py fit -c experiments/shapes_power.yaml -c experiments/profiler_pytorch.yaml
```


## Visualize reconstructed images during training

The config-file [callback_log_reconstructions.yaml](experiments/callback_log_reconstructions.yaml) can be appended to visualize the reconstructed images during training at W&B. Therefore, the W&B config-file must be appended as well.

```bash
python spherinator.py fit -c experiments/illustris_power.yaml \
    -c experiments/wandb.yaml \
    -c experiments/callback_log_reconstructions.yaml
```
